# Intro To Authentication Without Passport.js
> Using Node and Express

This app shows a barebones skeleton of what is needed for basic authentication in your Node app. *Made without using* [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) or any other authentication framework / library.

### NOT RECCOMENDED
This app is used *strictly for practice / learning purposes* and to gain insight into the lower level workings of authentication within [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). It is very unsecure to write your own code for handling user authentication. **Stick with a library written by SECURITY EXPERTS!**
****
## Why?
By following [this talk on authentication with Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkPqcIJvEPk), I was able to follow along and write code for authenticating users. Like I mentioned, this was just for me to see the inner workings and moving parts of Node authentication. From here on out I will start using [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) for all my security needs. But by doing this, I will have slightly deeper insight into what passport is actually doing for me.
>I highly reccomend anyone who is interested in authentication in NodeJS to watch the video that I linked to in the above paragraph
